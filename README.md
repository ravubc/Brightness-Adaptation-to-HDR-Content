# Brightness-Adaptation-to-HDR-Content
 The objective of this project is to mitigate the problem of Brightness Adjustment of the human eye when the surrounding brighness suddenly changes. 
 This problem is mitigated by adjusting the brightness of the video content based on the surrounding luminance. By utilizing the Human Visual System equation, we can manipulate our video in such a way that the human does not perceive a difference despite the change in luminance. 
 A subjective test of eighteen subjects was then devised to determine the efficacy of this algorithm.
